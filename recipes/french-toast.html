    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is the best French toast recipe. It's different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flour: </strong>This fluffy French toast batter starts with ¼ cup all-purpose flour. </li>
            <li><strong>Milk: </strong>Milk adds moisture and richness to the batter. You can substitute half-and-half, cream, or your favorite alternative milk if you like.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs: </strong>Of course, you’ll need eggs for French toast! Three eggs bind the batter together and give it a rich texture. </li>
            <li><strong>Sugar: </strong>A tablespoon of white sugar lends welcome sweetness to this decadent breakfast recipe. </li>
            <li><strong>Vanilla: </strong>A teaspoon of vanilla extract adds complexity and takes the flavor up a notch. </li>
            <li><strong>Cinnamon:</strong>Ground cinnamon lends coziness and warmth.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt: </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the flavors of the other ingredients, but it won’t make your French toast taste salty</li>
            <li><strong>Bread: </strong>You’ll need 12 slices of your favorite thick-sliced bread. Good choices include brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Slowly whisk the milk into the flour, then whisk in the remaining ingredients. </li>
            <li>Saturate the bread slices in the batter. </li>
            <li>Cook the French toast on a lightly oiled griddle or pan until golden on both sides.</li>
        </ol>
